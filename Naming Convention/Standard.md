# Naming Conventions in Java

In Java, following proper naming conventions is important for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. Naming conventions provide consistency across the codebase and help developers quickly understand the purpose of variables, methods, classes, and other components.

## 1. **Camel Case**
Camel case is a naming convention where the first word is lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter. This is typically used for variable names, method names, and non-class/interface identifiers.

### Example:
- **Variable name**: `userName`, `totalAmount`
- **Method name**: `getUserName()`, `calculateTotal()`
